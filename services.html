      </h2>
      <p>Our daily home care service helps you to stay at home with a visiting carer who can assist with support and personal care at the times of day when you need it. We at Forget-Me-Not Care Services understand that it can be hard to let a stranger into your home. This is why we carry out a thorough background check on all our carers before they can start their role and we ensure they maintain the highest training standards throughout. Our core values are to be honest, trustworthy, kind and safe with all our clients and their loved ones.</p>

      <p class="list-title">We offer a range of home care services such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Helping clients get out of bed</li>
        <li>Washing and dressing</li>
        <li>Meal preparation and cooking</li>
        <li>Light housework</li>
        <li>An evening visit to help with your night time routine</li>
        <li>Shop trips</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
      </ul>
       
       <p>The minimum duration of a visit is 30 minutes and we can provide as little as one visit a week or up to four visits a day. Our daily home care service (sometimes referred to as domiciliary care) is available across most parts of Surrey including Epsom & Ewell, Banstead & Tadworth, Worcester Park & Cheam, as well as surrounding areas.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>We all like to get out of the house now and again, so why should it be any different for our over 65’s? As our business grows, we would like to offer more day trips and social events to our clients. Due to modern life, work commitments and the fact more and more families live a considerable distance apart it can be hard to assist your loved ones with activities. This is where Forget-Me-Not Care Services aims to help, we can provide a qualified carer to take them out and about to a destination of their choice.</p>

        <p>Recent research shows many of our elderly population are feeling isolated or lonely. We aim to improve this statistic, through offering a cheerful companionship option. This could range from an hour or longer, whichever suits you best! It can take place in your home or if you have a place in mind why don’t we try there? Be it a lunch time treat, garden centre, community activity or a trip to the shops. It’s your choice.</p>

      <p>Have you or a loved one recently been discharged from hospital? You may only require a few visits to settle you back in to your home life. We can help get you back on to your feet again and you can choose when, where and how many visits work for you. If it helps, we can even offer to pick you up from the hospital/appointment at discharge and make that ever welcomed cup of tea when you get home.</p>
